# Using Git in this project

## ðŸ«’ Git branches

- `main`: The main branch. This branch is protected and can only be merged
  into when a new release of the app is ready via pull requests;
- `dev`: The development branch. This branch is protected and can only be
  merged into via pull requests;
- `<layer>/<type>/<description>`: An unprotected branch that will eventually get
  merged into `dev` where
  - `<layer>` is either `api` or `client`,
  - `<type>` is one of `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `refactor`, `test`, or
    `docs`, and
  - `<description>` is a short 2-3 word description;
- `release/<version>`: A read-only branch that captures the state of the
  project at a particular release.

## ðŸ’¬ Commit messages

We will be using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

In short, commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type><scope><exclamation mark>: <description>

<body>
```

where:

- `<type>` (**required**): one of `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
  `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`;
- `<scope>` (_optional_): a short description of the part of the project that is
  being changed and is enclosed in parentheses;
- `<exclamation mark>` (_optional_): an exclamation mark if the commit is a
  breaking change;
- `<description>` (**required**): a short description of the change;
- `<body>` (_optional_): the Git message body.

Examples (from the website):

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs
```

```
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

```
feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```
